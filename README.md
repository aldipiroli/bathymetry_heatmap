# Generates a heat map for bathymetry data.
Part of my bachelor thesis project. 

#### The data is gathered with a marine drone equipped with sensors and a GPS.

#### In order to create a heat map, a clustering polygons algorithm is applied.

#### Finally a color scale is applied on the specific polygon, rappresenting the collected data.
